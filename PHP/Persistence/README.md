# Persistence:

If you were to multply the digits of an integer multiple times, you would discover the sequence of products will always end with a single digit number. This single digit number is also known as a multiplicative persistence. Few examples:

814 -> 24 -> 8

35 -> 15 -> 5

5100 -> 0

Write the function called `persistence()` in Persistance.php that would calculate these numbers.
